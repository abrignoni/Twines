# Twines
Choose your own DFIR adventures

The purpose of this repository is the creation and sharing of interactive, nonlinear stories created with Twine. These 'choose your own adventure' stories will focus on digital forensics and incident response situations and will serve as training aids. The hope is that these if-else scenarios be used as interactive case studies for training purposes.

Twine can be found here: https://twinery.org/

Stories are hosted for viewing here: https://kapparino.updog.co/

Each folder will contain:
1) The story archive that can be imported to the Twine tool for editing.
2) Images used in the story.
3) The story in html format ready for hosting.
 
How to contribute:
1) Story ideas and/or scripts. 
2) Contributors sharing their DFIR stories in the repository using twine. 
3) Some CSS stylesheets. 
4) English proofreading and editing skills.
