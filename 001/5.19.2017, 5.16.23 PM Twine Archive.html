&quot;MAC ddresses, or Media Access Control Addresses, are unique idenfifiers assigned to network adapters such as the network card in your desktop, or the Wi-Fi card. Its purpose is simple; being able to distinguish one network adapter or network interface from one another, and through it, the different networked devices.&quot;

So each MAC address is unique to the card the device uses to communicate, hence each entry on this document is most likely a different device that has connected to the network. Maybe this number can be used to identify devices since it is unique...

2) Devices are connected to router wirelessly therefore they are most likely on or have been off recently before the document was printed.

3) No device named NAS has been accounted for so far in the house. What could NAS mean?

4) All these unique MAC addresses should match with the devices we have found so far.

Hmm....

[[You seize the documents and the router-&gt;Pull the plug and seize]]

&quot;A Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS is specialized for serving files either by its hardware, software, or configuration.&quot;

So it is a central storage location for files!!!!

You talk to the search team members and realize that the whole residence has been searched with the exception of the small crawlspace in the attic. Bingo!!!

Armed with the fact that a deviced name NAS in the network might be yet to be found you brave the dust and some some spider webs in order to search the attic.

Pay dirt (more like pay dust):

&lt;img src=&quot;wirelessnas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nas&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;&gt;

By looking at the manifacturer tag behind the device you match the MAC address from the document to the device itself. Yes!!!

Knowing that evidence might be located in this hidden storage device you talk to digital forensics personnel. They advise on how to safely disconnect the device for seizure and analysis.

By following the clues and doing some quick reasearch, a trove of incriminating evidence has been located.
